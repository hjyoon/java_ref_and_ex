Rather than trying to avoid impeachment, the President is now welcoming a swift vote so he can defend himself in a subsequent trial in the Senate, where Republicans are in the majority. Shortly before Pelosi's announcement, he had tweeted, "if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast." Remember: The White House sought to block nearly all cooperation with the impeachment inquiry.CNN's Manu Raju asked Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy if it's ever OK for a President to investigate someone like Joe Biden (a domestic political rival). The California Republican said something about the Democrats having always wanted to impeach Trump, mentioned the warnings of the Founding Fathers and then walked away. Watch it.
Biden, who Republicans may try to force to testify in a Senate trial, became angry with a voter in New Hampton, Iowa, after the man challenged him over his son's involvement with Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company. "You're a damn liar, man, that's not true," Biden responded. "And no one has ever said that, no one has proved that." He also challenged the man to a pushup or IQ contest when the man challenged his age and mental fitness.
