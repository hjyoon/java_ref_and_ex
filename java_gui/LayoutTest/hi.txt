A new trailer for Disney's live-action remake of the movie "Mulan" is receiving positive reviews on social media, except in Hong Kong where protesters are calling for a boycott.

They are objecting to the personal views of lead actress Liu Yifei, who earlier this year expressed support for Hong Kong police, who protesters have accused of brutality.
The film, due for release in March 2020, is a remake of the 1998 Disney cartoon, which traced the journey of a young Chinese woman who joins the army by pretending to be a boy.
The animated original was itself a retelling of the ancient legend of Hua Mulan, described by the Chinese government as "the most recognizable folk heroine in Chinese culture."
